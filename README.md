## üßº Data Cleaning Steps

To ensure data quality, the following cleaning steps were applied to the **SuperStore Sales Dataset**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Remove Unnecessary Columns**  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns like `Row ID`, `ind1`, and `ind2`.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Handle Missing Values**  
   - Removed rows with missing values in key columns (`Order ID`, `Customer ID`, `Product ID`).  
   - Filled missing values in `Profit`, `Sales`, or `Quantity` with appropriate defaults (0 or median).  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Remove Duplicates**  
   - Checked for duplicate rows based on `Order ID` and `Product ID` and removed them.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Standardize Date Formats**  
   - Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to `YYYY-MM-DD` format.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Fix Data Types**  
   - Converted `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Quantity` to numeric format.  
   - Ensured `Order Date` and `Ship Date` were in datetime format.  

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Remove Outliers**  
   - Detected and removed extreme values in `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Quantity` using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score or IQR).  

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Standardize Text Fields**  
   - Converted text columns (`Customer Name`, `Product Name`, `Category`) to title case.
